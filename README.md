This a project I did with a help of a course in order to improve my coding abilities 
I already know how to code in other programming languages but during university 
I did not ficus on web development and now I am trying to become a full stack developer
My final goal is to do my own web page that will act as my CV but still a long way to go 
but at least I am improving.
